Geometry and Photometry in Computer Vision
This repository contains codes and reports for the course 'Geometry and Photometry in Computer Vision (Jan - May 2018)'. 

Assignment 1 - Image Rectification
Q1. Computation of transformation matrix directly using 4 points and their transformed corrected coordinates.
Q2. Image rectification upto similarity by first computing the line at infinity and then computing the dual conic.
Q3. Image rectification upto similarity in a single step using 4-5 perpendiculat directions.
Q4. Image Rectification upto similarity by ﬁnding a transformed circle and directly ﬁnding the circular points by intersecting it with the line at inﬁnity.

Assignment 2 - Camera Calibration
Q1. Assuming full K matrix, computaion of absolute conic by a) using 5 perpendicular directions b) computing the homography relation between a metric co-ordinate system ﬁxed to the scene plane and the image of the same (3 such homographies are computed). 
Q2. Assuming square pixels, computaion of absolute conic by a) using 3 perpendicular directions b) computing the homography relation between a metric co-ordinate system ﬁxed to the scene plane and the image of the same (2 such homographies are computed). 

Assignment 3 - Fundamental Matrix 
Q1. Computation using 7-point and 8-point algorithms.
Q2. Estimation using SIFT and RANSAC using 7-point and 8-point algorithms as base. Comparisons of number of iterations RANSAC takes to converge.
