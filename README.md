Geometry and Photometry in Computer Vision <br><br>
This repository contains codes and reports for the course 'Geometry and Photometry in Computer Vision (Jan - May 2018). <br><br>

Assignment 1 - Image Rectification <br>
Q1. Computation of transformation matrix directly using 4 points and their transformed corrected coordinates.<br>
Q2. Image rectification upto similarity by first computing the line at infinity and then computing the dual conic.<br>
Q3. Image rectification upto similarity in a single step using 4-5 perpendiculat directions.<br>
Q4. Image Rectification upto similarity by ﬁnding a transformed circle and directly ﬁnding the circular points by intersecting it with the line at inﬁnity.<br><br>

Assignment 2 - Camera Calibration<br>
Q1. Assuming full K matrix, computaion of absolute conic by a) using 5 perpendicular directions b) computing the homography relation between a metric co-ordinate system ﬁxed to the scene plane and the image of the same (3 such homographies are computed). <br>
Q2. Assuming square pixels, computaion of absolute conic by a) using 3 perpendicular directions b) computing the homography relation between a metric co-ordinate system ﬁxed to the scene plane and the image of the same (2 such homographies are computed). <br><br>

Assignment 3 - Fundamental Matrix <br>
Q1. Computation using 7-point and 8-point algorithms.<br>
Q2. Estimation using SIFT and RANSAC using 7-point and 8-point algorithms as base. Comparisons of number of iterations RANSAC takes to converge.<br>
